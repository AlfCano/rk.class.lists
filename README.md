# rk.class.lists
This package provides a suite of RKWard plugins designed to simplify the manipulation of R object classes and data structures. It offers a graphical interface for coercing objects (e.g., converting a matrix to a data frame), changing vector types (e.g., numeric to factor), and performing complex list operations (creating, appending, and extracting)
